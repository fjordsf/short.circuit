<h3>William Lark</h3>
<p>I am an interaction designer with deep hardware/software development expertise, focusing on bridging the gap between design and engineering, and thinking through building.

In Meyers-Briggs terms, I am an INTJ, bordering on INTP.

I focus on developing hardware and software that maintains a coherent, understandable, and usable API for ease of rapid iteration and development across multiple teams. I consider technology as a sketching tool for new ideas in the medium of the modern world.

I appreciate: good humor and a willingness to get weird.

<h3>William Felker</h3>
<p>I have have been using this: Over the past year I have been researching emerging technologies (such as blockchain, speculative interfaces, and IOT) to understand how to best translate them into comprehensive prototypes which demonstrate their affect on a given industry. These prototypes have been a mix of holding workshops, design fiction essays, presentations and physical prototypes with embedded electronics. In my daily work I am driven by learning and implementing new technologies through collaborating with others that allow me to expand how I execute my work.
