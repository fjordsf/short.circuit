<h3>William Lark</h3>
<p>I am an interaction designer with deep hardware/software development expertise, focusing on bridging the gap between design and engineering, and thinking through building.

In Meyers-Briggs terms, I am an INTJ, bordering on INTP.

I focus on developing hardware and software that maintains a coherent, understandable, and usable API for ease of rapid iteration and development across multiple teams. I consider technology as a sketching tool for new ideas in the medium of the modern world.

I appreciate: good humor and a willingness to get weird.

this is what excites me…this is what drives me.
